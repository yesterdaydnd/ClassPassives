# Class Passives and Feat Tiering

This homebrew attempts to give players more options to customize the type of character they wish to make, and incentivize characters to take flavorful options – a barbarian might be way more interesting if they’re wearing a Chef’s attire and take the Chef feat while fighting with an meat cleaver, for instance. At the same time, it allows players to have greater control over where they want their character's build to go.

## What and why?

The first change comes from acknowledging that feats have different power levels and that that is, in and of itself, fine. 
Both Sharpshooter and Weapon Master have their place in the game, however if they compete for the same resource (very important ASIs), Sharpshooter is going to
win every single time, simply because it gives more bang for your buck and the amount of feats available to players is very limited.

At the same time, characters are required, in a way, to further complement their builds with magic items in order to stay competitive against higher CR creatures.
This can create some issues: maybe the DM doesn't like throwing too many magic items, or simply like them rare or random - this makes it difficult for a player to
properly fine tune their character to whatever they intend to do.

To help mitigate these issues, and to add a little bit more complexity to character creation, two systems are added through this homebrew: Class Passives and 
Feat Tiering.
